### Originality
This foretells which part of codes i import from external sources, and which parts i wrote myself

1. [Kite - Connecting Scatter Plot](https://kite.com/python/answers/how-to-make-a-connected-scatter-plot-in-matplotlib-in-python) -> I use this as a reference for making my draw / display function.

2. [Udacity - Computational Photograpy](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud955) -> Especially lesson 23. This is where almost all of my resource came from. It provides you with so much better explanation on 2D transformation.

3. [Affine and Projective Transformation](https://www.graphicsmill.com/docs/gm5/Transformations.htm) -> This just an addeb bonus on affine and projective transformation.

4. [Study - Translation](https://study.com/academy/answer/why-is-translation-not-a-linear-transformation.html) -> This is a reference on translation transformation being non linear transformation.

5. Of course our main book 'Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications' by Richard Szeliski.

Aside from my draw function, i write all of my own code. From the algorithm to the code itself.
