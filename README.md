# Affine Transformation

Name : Hafizhun Alim

## Objectives
In this task we were asked to do affine transformation. Affine transfomation could do the following transformation simultaneously.
* Scalling
* Rotation
* Shearing
* Translation
And then we were asked to do projective transfomation which is just an affine transfomation comhine with projective/perspective warp.

## 2D Linear Transformation
Before we understand affine transformation, first we will take a look at 2D Linear transformation. A 2D point in cartesian coordinate can be denoted by a pair of value p = (x, y) or in matrix form
          
          p = [[x], 
               [y]]
